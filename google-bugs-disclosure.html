<div><div class="%"><p><code>I can bypass html, on Gmail Nov 24, 2019 02:54:01 +0000 (UTC) 
</code><br>
I published this, because I felt something strange from the beginning I sent a report to Google.<br>
I think this vulnerability is correct, because it takes a very fast.<br>
but i don't sleep, time on Jakarta is 09:54AM<br>
I just test, very simple and report about XSRF-Token.<br>
because i see Xsrf-Token, on this action :)<br> and code CSRF is failed :)

<center><br>and one thing, this turns out that after this report 3 days ago+ they have already investigated more,<br> then they ask:<br></center>
</p><div> <p><code>ko...@google.com</code><br>
<code>I am not sure I understand. <br>How would the XSRF token be sent? Gmail for sure uses some XSRF tokens,<br> but it doesn't send them for external requests, <br>so I'm not sure what you're demonstrating you're bypassing here.
<br>Sure, you can use Gmail to make users send requests to websites,<br>but Gmail doesn't automatically add any tokens to those requests.
<br><br><code>Steps to reproduce</code><br>
<div class="s"><pre class="s"><code><span class="err">1. <span class="n">Attacker copy content on malicious files :)
2. Attacker paste on Gmail and send to victim :)
only requires answering When did you create this Google Account?
3. When victim click the Email malicious :) victim is successful use XSRF-Token :)
</pre></div>
<center><br><br><code>Attack scenario:</code><br></center>
<div class="s"><pre class="s"><code><span class="err">1. <span class="n">an attacker can make html injection in the email form :)
2. an attacker can bypass POST (csrf) using the email form
only requires answering When did you create this Google Account?
3. attackers can insert important urls, which are on all important Google products.
4. the attacker can jump over the XSRF-Token (because in the PoC video above,<br> first the victim clicks! proves it was successful without using the Xsrf Token<br> because the victim had already brought the xsrf token.)
</pre></div>
<p>I certainly know, this is contrary to the real writing on their <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/xsrf-with-meaningless-action" style="color:#eeff00;">nonvuln (click).</a><br><br>
<code>ko...@google.com</code><br>
Hey,<br>

We cannot reproduce the issue you're reporting. <br>Please update this report with additional details. <br>What exact steps are needed for the reproduction,<br> especially the steps areound generating the URL that later on gets XSRFed.
<br><br>
<code>me</code><br>
Hi Google,<br>

on bugs-gmail-bypass it will produce a URL that you can copy, :)<br> and paste in an email (Gmail).<br>
file code bugs-gmail-bypass : REDACTED <br>i Sent new Steps :) and logs.
<br><br>
<code>me</code><br>
sent new comment please don't investigate it.<br> ( i'm sent wrong comment, because there is important! i'm disappointed. )
<br><br><code>me</code><br>
but you can continue to investigate it,<br> it's your duty if you really find vulnerability!<br> from what I sent,
please don't read comments: #blahblah and #blahblah<br>

because there is something strange, :)<br>
why is there no Xsrf token error notification?<br>if only GET iamInvite/checkRequired and<br> I feel at iamInvite/invite? It was fixed before I tried it.<br>
but the important thing is,<br> why isn't there an error notification???<br>
Invalid xsrf token??<br> like a the initial video I sent? <br>when attacker just send link on email, not use bugs-gmail-bypass.<br>

really disappointed me, what happened?
<br></p><br>
<center><code>Special Message:</code><br>
  "I don't want my trust in Google lost, but what happened?<br>
truly extraordinary, beyond my logic as a human being.<br>
as it shows, you guys are very smart because you guys have the resources <br>and me don't know how you guys work... and I'm a stupid external person :) LOL."
